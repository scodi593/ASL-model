# **American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition Model**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system** that uses **deep learning and computer vision** to classify hand gestures. The model is trained on an ASL dataset using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and deployed with **OpenCV** for real-time webcam-based detection. It aims to improve accessibility by accurately identifying ASL hand signs and displaying predictions with confidence scores.  

## **Features**  
- **Real-time ASL detection** using a webcam and OpenCV.  
- **CNN-based deep learning model** for hand gesture classification.  
- **Preprocessing and data augmentation** for improved model accuracy.  
- **Interactive user experience** with on-screen predictions.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, ImageDataGenerator  
- **Programming Language:** Python  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Model Training:**  
   - Loads ASL dataset and applies **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, zooming).  
   - Trains a **CNN model** to classify different ASL hand signs.  
   - Saves trained model (`asl_model.h5`).  

2. **Real-time Detection:**  
   - Captures frames from a **webcam** using OpenCV.  
   - Extracts the **Region of Interest (ROI)** containing the hand gesture.  
   - Preprocesses the image (resizing, normalization) and feeds it to the trained model.  
   - Predicts the ASL sign and displays the result with a **confidence score**.  

## **Installation & Usage**  
### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ASL-Recognition.git  
cd ASL-Recognition  
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```

### **3. Train the Model** (Optional)  
```bash
python train_asl_model.py
```

### **4. Run Real-Time Detection**  
```bash
python main.py
```

## **Future Improvements**  
- Integrate **pre-trained models (MobileNetV2, ResNet)** for better accuracy.  
- Deploy as a **web or mobile app** for accessibility.  
- Implement **LSTM-based recognition** to interpret ASL words and sentences.
